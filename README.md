# random_list_mixer
Pulls an individual value from numerous lists and returns a concatination of
them. Built as a quick tool for a friend! :)

## Setup
- Store your lists in the lists folder with the executable.
- Lists should be comma seperated with spaces, eg: a, b, c
- List values are concatenated in the order the lists are read in.
- Lists are read in in alphabetical order.
- Upon adding new entries to the lists, re-run the executable.
